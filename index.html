                <p class="text">Our internet and data usage add up to 2% of C02 emissions worldwide – this is due to the electric power we use to keep them running. To set this figure in perspective: this is the same as the entire airline industry! And the number is growing. As shown during the pandemic, our digital legacy will grow to 5 – 7% in the future. We need to stop this. And that’s easy! <br /><br />

                        It’s easy to stop growing our own digital footprint. Streaming your favorite series in high definition, usages 86% more energy than enjoying it in standard settings. Turning off your camera during an online meeting saves 96% of carbon emissions. We need to be aware that our digital usage costs energy and therefore: CO2 emissions.

                    To make a difference, the Big Tech companies – like Google, Meta (Facebook), Salesforce, HubSpot, Amazon, Zoom, Microsoft and many more – need to join our mission. They are storing all our data and aren’t making it easy to clean this up. They have this data hunger, that adds up to more and more and more CO2 emissions.

                    So just sit down in your chair and help us with to start the biggest digital clean up in the world. Together we will get the big tech companies on board and we will get our goal: no longer CO2 emissions due to digital waste. The plan is simple and contains two simple steps.
